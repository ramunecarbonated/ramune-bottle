### Offensive Commands Automatically Locked
Worried about possible offensive commands? These are locked behind one of the several small configuration settings which are very easy to set. Commands which can be considered offensive require the `All Commands` setting to be turned `on`.

### Chaining
The bot remembers pictures previously posted in a text channel, allowing you and friends to re-use pictures posted by the bot, another person and even another bot without having to copy a link or save an image.

### Mobile Data Friendly
Worried about your mobile data plan draining due to the possible size of the (possible flood of) images? The bot compresses images with little visible compression before sending.
