### Offensive Commands Automatically Locked
Worried about possible offensive commands? These are locked behind one of the several small configuration settings which are very easy to set. Commands which can be considered offensive require the `All Commands` setting to be turned `on`.

### Chaining
The bot remembers pictures previously posted in a text channel, allowing you and friends to re-use pictures posted by the bot, another person and even another bot for easy re-use without having to copy a link or save an image.

### Mobile Data Friendly
Worried about your users on mobile data draining their data plan due to the possible size of the images? The bot compresses images with little visible compression, allowing for fast processing and chaining of commands.
